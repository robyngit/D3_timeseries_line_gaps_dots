# Option A
## gaps in data shown as dotted lines

---

**PROS:**
- missing data clearly differentiated.

**CONS:**
- data points with missing data the month before and after are 'hidden' (e.g. May 2014).

---

**Features:**
- gaps in data shown with dotted line
- mini 'brush' chart shows the context of the data in focus in the main chart
- x-axis zooming and panning is limited to the range of available data
- y-axis resizes automatically to match the maximum y-value of the data in focus
- buttons zoom focus to an interval equal to one year (if sufficient data), one month, or the range of the data
- text at top changes to indicate the range of data in focus
- when no data is available, displays text instead
- sorts data by date
